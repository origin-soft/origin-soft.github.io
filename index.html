            <p>As English originates from multi-syllabic words, Chinese originates from mono-syllabic ideograms or characters. Reading and recognizing ideograms is the key to learning Chinese. Hone your Chinese reading, Mandarin and Cantonese recognition skills with this simple card pairing game.</p>

            <p>Ideogram has:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Almost 10K of most common modern ideograms, covering characters encountered in over 99.999% of cases.</li>
                <li>Multiple speakers for Mandarin (Taiwan and Mainland China) and Cantonese (Hong Kong), who pronounce characters as you match them.</li>
                <li>Smart random generator, so that the most common ideograms are presented first.</li>
                <li>Expansive in-game dictionary that lists definitions, use cases, variants (simplified and traditional), and other similar sounding characters.</li>
            </ul>


            <p>Choose from three different players modes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>[Solo] Practice against yourself</li>
                <li>[Player vs. AI] Train against AI</li>
                <li>[Player vs. Player] Compete against friends through Game Center</li>
            </ul>


            <p>Select from three different types of matching. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identical matching (which requires you to match characters that look exactly the same).</li>
                <li>Variant matching (which requires you to match different forms of the same character).</li>
                <li>Mandarin & Cantonese matching (which requires you to match characters that sound the same).</li>
            </ul>


            <p>The base version provides 50+ additional card decks. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HK Grade Level 1-6 decks (6)</li>
                <li>Stroke count-based decks (5)</li>
                <li>Radical-based decks (40+)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Chinese is a difficult language for beginners. It is also a very expansive language, encompassing many regions and dialects. Playing Ideogram is a easy and fun way for students of all skill levels to learn and improve their Chinese anytime.</p>
